# Notes
for when i get ideas and stuff

## Project due September 17th

## 9/2/23
&emsp; Set up randLED function, using different way to assign it a number than the random(start,stop) function. Its not as nice looking because of the C++ type casting, but i wanted to make sure thats not the issue, still need to test it though. 

- Goals for today
    - forget about a nicer looking hardware setup and get code that
    actually works
    - figure out why BLUE LED is not working and is possibly breaking the program (?) 
    - try somethibng other than switch statement (?) ( would mean i dont need the enum and might make my life easier even if the code isn't as pretty)
    - get SOMETHING done
