# Three-LED-reaction-time
UCLA Physics 4AL final project

## Introduction
Reaction time is the time between the presentation of a stimulus and the occurrence of a specific response to it.
Our project will focus on an LED stimulus, with red, green, and blue LEDS; as well as a button pressing response, one for each, in order to record the time. 
This project is similar to Lab 1C (UCLA Physics Dept.) which compares reaction time for two different stimuli types. 
Similar reaction time labs have been done but do not measure the effect of different distractions in addition to multiple color LEDs. 
This approach brings a unique perspective to our project.  

## Project Goal 
Our goal for this project is to test reaction time with regards to distraction. 
We would like to test how reaction time differs when the subject is exposed to different levels of distractions. 
We plan to achieve this goal by collecting reaction time data in different levels of distraction. 
The control will be with no distractions. The first level will be a TV show playing. 
The second level will be TV and music playing. We will have 3 LED stimuli and record the time it takes for the subject to press a button in response to one specific color of light, which will vary randomly for each participant. 
We plan to collect 80 sets of data using the arduino setup below.
